This project is ongoing as I follow along with John Smilga's HTML and CSS tutorial. The goal of following along with his tutorial is to get more comfortable with using HTML and CSS, as well as to explore the capabilities of these languages.

Of note: Visual Studio Code does not recognize one of the font settings provided in the tutorial. This is something I will want to explore and troubleshoot.
