# About

This project is ongoing as I follow along with John Smilga's HTML/CSS tutorial video (available here: https://www.udemy.com/user/janis-smilga-3/). The goal of following along with his tutorial is to get more comfortable with using HTML and CSS, as well as to learn about the design capabilities and functionality of CSS.


# Of Note
Visual Studio Code does not recognize one of the font settings provided in the tutorial. This is something I will want to explore and troubleshoot.
